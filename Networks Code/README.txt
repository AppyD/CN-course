This folder contains 6 python modules for the Network Project and a PDF copy of the report.

The 'networks_project' module contains the general functions used to complete the tasks in the report.

'phase_one', 'phase_two', and 'phase_three' are the code used to obtain the plots and results in the report. The necessary parameters are initialised at the top of these files.

'phase_two_k1' is an example of the code used to examine the largest expected degree, k1, in the form of a function to be called with the desired parameters.
